# Bi-LSTM-Max-Entropy-Markov-Random-Field-Model

Targeted sentiment analysis aims to capture sentiment expressed towards an entity in a given sentence. The task consists of two parts, Named Entity Recognition (identifying the entity) and
identifying whether there is a sentiment directed towards the entity. For the purpose of this project, we will focus on doing them in a collapsed way (combining sentiment and named entity recognition
into one label sequence, and trying to predict that sequence). 

This project implement a Deep Maximum Entropy Markov Model (DMEMM) for the targeted sentiment task using the given dataset.
